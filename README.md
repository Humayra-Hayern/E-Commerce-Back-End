# 13) ORM: E-Commerce-Back-End

For this project I had to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Utilised Express.js to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Technology Used:

- Javascript
- Node.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Express.js

## Instructions

Firstly make sure all dependencies are installed by typing npm i in the console.

Then enter source db/schema.sql into the MySQL shell.

Then return to the console and type npm run seed to seed the example data into the database.

Finally to start the server, type npm start into the console.
